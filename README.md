# Original Assets

All the scripts (unless scripts provided during class exercices) used in game were created 100% from scratch. They are all inside the "Scripts" folder.

For example, the dialogue system with its custom editor (Go to "Graph > Dialogue Graph Editor") were all created from scratch by Marcus Aas Jensen (group's leader).

Group's leader already had a loit of experience using Unity

Little Princess model was created from scratch with just human proportion references using Blender.

Stickman character's Sprite was drawn by hand.

All icons such as control indications, mouse cursor, or the video game icon were created using Figma.

Game's music is original and was created by Marcus Aas Jensen.

Some SFX were created with real voices (Marc Pinet's voice for Stickman), or used from another game created by Marcus Aas Jensen (horse race laps SFX from "Uncanny"): https://marcus-a.itch.io/uncanny 

Of course, all of the models and animations from the Museum scene were created by each member of the group. Also, all the controllers were created from scratch.

Though we used a lot of assets, the environment was created with a lot of thoughts on level design and game feel according to storytelling.

Some created assets were never used, such as the Counsellor's Office original music and the Counsellor's model.
