# ✨ Little Princess : a forgotten idea about to come to life ✨

A game about Little Princess, a forgotten idea in Emily's mind, longs to be remembered and come to life...

## School Project Requirements 📝
>[!WARNING]
>This game is supposed to be a school project. Though I'm leaving it as it is, it has a lot of bugs, glitches, and is not suitable for some users (no options for performance issues and requires a pc running at 60 fps for the best experience). Therefore, make sure to read the *"Instructions while playing"* section before starting the game. 
> Also, it is mostly a narrative game with not much gameplay into it. It is my first attempt at making a short but efficient video game story. I'm opened to any feedback on the story since it is a skill I really want to develop.

According to the requirements of having at least 3 scenes, there are a total of 11 scenes in our game.

However, the game is structured to have 2 main scenes, with transition scenes in between to have a coherent story throughout the game. These "transition" scenes will then be considered as our third main scene, since they are necessary for the story and show how the dialogue system was implemented.

Thanks to Loris DRID for helping to build some elements of the different environments (museum, forest and desert, UWUKnight).
Thanks to Arthur Rodriguez and Marc Pinet for their funny models and animations (Teddy Bear and Homerd).

# Original Assets 👾

All the scripts (unless scripts provided during class exercices) used in game were created 100% from scratch. They are all inside the "Scripts" folder.

For example, the dialogue system with its custom editor (Go to "Graph > Dialogue Graph Editor") were all created from scratch by Marcus Aas Jensen (group's leader).

Group's leader already had a loit of experience using Unity

Little Princess model was created from scratch with just human proportion references using Blender.

Stickman character's Sprite was drawn by hand.

All icons such as control indications, mouse cursor, or the video game icon were created using Figma.

Game's music is original and was created by Marcus Aas Jensen.

Some SFX were created with real voices (Marc Pinet's voice for Stickman), or used from another game created by Marcus Aas Jensen (horse race laps SFX from "Uncanny"): https://marcus-a.itch.io/uncanny 

Of course, all of the models and animations from the Museum scene were created by each member of the group. Also, all the controllers were created from scratch.

Though we used a lot of assets, the environment was created with a lot of thoughts on level design and game feel according to storytelling.

Some created assets were never used, such as the Counsellor's Office original music and the Counsellor's model.
